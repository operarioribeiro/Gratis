## Open Theory of Change:

**Gratis** [theory of change (ToC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_change) synthesizes fourteen years of [field research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_research) working with the most respected international solidarity organizations, commons defense, and philanthropic international movements. It echoes the data in the [Global Philanthropy](https://wings.issuelab.org/resource/the-global-landscape-of-philanthropy.html) and the [State of The Commons](https://creativecommons.org/2022/04/05/2021-annual-report) reports from where we analyzed the following difficulties of agents and institutions and developed our free open source solutions (FLOSS):

*Citizens Current Problems:*
- Lack of information and access to solidarity, online and local, intitatives.
- Want to help people in need without giving them money.
- Want to donate objects, expert services, and money but don't know who to exactly.

**Gratis Solutions for Citizens:**
- With our platform the public may get to know the solidary ecosystem, meeting gratuitous solutions for what they need.
- Our app gives address and contact to local solidary initiatives that may be given to people without internet, instead of money.
- Our solidarity social network allows people to make available their commons, be it a product, service, or event.

*Solidarity Institutions Current Problems:*
- Quality of donations.
- Lack of support and material resources.
- Lack of volunteers.
- Lack of free qualification and scalable growth assistance.

**Gratis Solutions for Solidarity Institutions:**
- Publishing in our platform the institutions promote themselves glocally for philanthropic investors and crowdsourcing microfinancers.
- Institutions may also search for volunteer specifically for their needs not only in their communites, but online.
- Our network allows a larger assistance intercommunication among the world solidarity community with the free sharing of courses, incubators, and events.

*Philanthropic Investors Current Problems:*
- Lack of databases about the actions of small and medium size institutions.
- Lack of systemic information on the solidary market.

**Gratis Solutions for Philanthropic Investors:**
- By researching and allowing solidary initiative to self-insert in our system we use crowdsourcing to also audit and measure them.
- Being fully developed in open source and data, our platform makes available glocal philanthropic data, researches, and reports.

*Commons and Solidarity Networks Current Problems:*
- Difficulty engaging community in common causes policymaking and advocacy.
- Lack of popular visibility in traditional media and organic traffic.

**Gratis Solutions for Commons and Solidarity Networks:**
- By spontaneous and paid promotion of the solidarity movement our project educates for institutional dialogue.
- Our project is aimed at the promotion of the commons ecosystem serving as a catalyzer of new initiatives in its favour.
